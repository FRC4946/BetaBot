Basic example code for our FIRST robot. (haha, get it? Our first robot?)

Features:
  - 2 joysticks, one for Task and one for Drive
  - Variable speed, based on the trigger of the Drive joystick
  
Special in this branch:
  - A 4 motor configuration of the RobotDrive
  - A potential pneumatics setup
  - Some TODOs, and a layout of what our autonomus function should do
